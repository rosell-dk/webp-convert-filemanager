# WebP Convert filemanager
At current stage (version 0.1) you can browse the image files and compare the original vs the converted file.

This front-end of course requires a backend. The API is subject to heavy change and is not documented yet. To see it in live action, you can however try the WebP Express plugin for Wordpress (available from release 0.21.0).

## Whats new?
Everything is new! This is the first tentative pre-alpha work-in-progress release.

## Whats planned ahead?
Next thing is of course to enable you to trigger conversions.
