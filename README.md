# WebP Convert filemanager
Front end for converting images to webp.

Best described with a couple of screenshots:

## File Properties

## Conversion Options

This front-end of course requires a backend. The API is subject to heavy change and is not documented yet. To see it in live action, you can however try the WebP Express plugin for Wordpress (available from release 0.21.0).
