# WebP Convert filemanager
Front end for converting images to webp.

It works well with the [webp-convert](https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert) backend. It however requires "more" backend than that, ie for getting file tree. This API is still subject to change and is not documented yet. To see it in live action, you can however try the WebP Express plugin for Wordpress (available from release 0.21.0).

Here are some screenshots:
